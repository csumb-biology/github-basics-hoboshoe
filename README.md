# This is my first github repository!

## I am very excited

I can use markdown to *italicize* and **bold** my text.

Also, I can [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0) to interesting 
things that I find on the internet.

When I get home I am going to:
1. Write some emails
1. Grade a quiz
1. Read a paper
1. Go to bed

```{python}
for i in range(10)
  print i
```
